<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div> 
	Hello there, my name is Jasleen Grewal. I just finished by PhD at UBC. This website is where I hope to squander my spare time in the future, sharing my dirty code and over-enthusiastic rants with those who care to read them.
	This particular page will hopefully be updated and backfilled periodically, and not gather e-dust.

A concise CV of mine can be <a href="https://jasgrewal.github.io/cv_jg/">found here</a>
