<div> 
	Hello there, my name is Jasleen Grewal. I am a PhD student at UBC. This page is where I hope to squander my spare time in the future, sharing my dirty code and over-enthusiastic rants with those who care to read them.
	This page will hopefully be updated and backfilled periodically, and not gather e-dust.
