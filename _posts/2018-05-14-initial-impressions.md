I thought it will take forever to get set up with a website using purely GitHub functionality, but it ain't half as bad as I thought! Only thing that I'm probably messing up right now is the slight lag in updating the main website once I push my changes.  
The next bit in the plan is to update the graphics for this website solely using XML and SVG. Lately I've come to appreciate the power of SVG in image modifications a bit more, so hopefully this task will put my skills to test. And generally help me waste time while I wait for my models to be trained.....
