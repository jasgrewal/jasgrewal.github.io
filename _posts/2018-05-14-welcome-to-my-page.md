# I finally found a theme I liked!  
I have realised that the amount of time I spend prettifying tiny details is horrendous - but I have no shame. Take, for example, this website. I have tinkered around with atleast 5 other themes, ultimately settling on this beauty by [leonids](https://renyuanz.github.io/leonids/).  
Hope to make this a regularly documented nook for my thoughts and documents. If you have stumbled here by mistake, hit that close button.  
First mistake though, accidentally initialized this document for 2017. Grrrr how the time flies, hello 2018.
