- name: NGS and cancer diagnostics  
  descr: "I worked on my PhD at the BC Cancer Agency in <a target='_blank' href='https://www.bcgsc.ca/people/steven-jones'>Dr. Steve Jones' group</a>. During this time, I worked on developing machine learning methods for cancer diagnosis. Besides my thesis research I also collaborated with pathologists [<a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405803319300184'> 1</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=1918915X&AN=139556875&h=MkTdjTIbxUwkSExUonqzC0Rdgy5Ojz8nqQZbrSEWcHkdHET%2bVVv3fyckoy6X5HNuOa%2fMAUQnKCu43rI0Mcz0ug%3d%3d&crl=c&resultNs=AdminWebAuth&resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d1918915X%26AN%3d139556875'> 2</a>], oncologists [<a target='_blank' href='https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.18.00325'> 3</a>], and research scientists [<a target='_blank' href='http://molecularcasestudies.cshlp.org/content/5/3/a003814.short'> 4</a>] on an assortment of precision oncology projects covering machine learning in healthcare, genomic analysis of rare cancer-types, and treatment outcomes from precision oncology efforts."   
  detaildescr: "Metastatic disease forms 90% of cancer associated deaths, and the identification of the site of origin of these cancers is an important first step in treatment. Cancer diagnosis usually comes from surveying the pathology of the tissue itself. However, pathology diagnostics can be confounded by complex presentation and pathologist experience, leading to misdiagnosis rates of up to 70% in certain disease etiologies. <br> My project was motivated by a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701302/'> case study from 2013</a>, in which transcriptomic analysis (looking at the gene expression of specific genes being expressed in the cancer) led to re-alignment of diagnosis for a patient with advanced vulvar cancer. Recent findings from this approach show promise for providing biological context in <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5880267/'>rare cancer types</a>."
- name: Circulating tumour DNA detection using exome sequencing  
  descr: "Exome sequencing allows us to sequence ~1% of the total genome. Circulating tumour DNA (ct-DNA) in turn, can comprise <1% of total DNA found in the bloodstream. Can we use exome sequencing to detect ct-DNA in patients where we have the genomic profile of the actual tumour for context? This was my main research question in <a target='_blank' href='https://www.sfu.ca/mbb/people/research-faculty/morin/'>Dr. Ryan Morin's lab at SFU</a>, during my undergraduate degree. <br> The proposed plan was to detect copy number variants in the tumour genome, and see if we could detect a similar 'scale-up' in the acquisition of reads in these regions from the ct-DNA sequencing. <br> As these things invariably go for a beginner bioinformatician, I instead spent the bulk of my time in the Morin lab learning loads about <a target='_blank' href='http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/22/9/2290.long'>using next generation sequencing data for cancer research</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/128/11/1490.long'>integrating different NGS data to understand a cancer type</a>, and how to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28655203/'>write code that doesn't break if I update a single tool</a>. I was also peripherally involved in ongoing work in the lab that <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437943/'>aimed to make genomic analysis accessible to wet-lab folks in bioinformatics.</a>"
