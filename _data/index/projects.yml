- name: Circulating tumour DNA detection using exome sequencing  
  descr: "Exome sequencing gives us 1% of the total genome. Circulating tumour DNA (ct-DNA) in turn, can comprise <1% of total DNA found in the bloodstream. Can we use exome sequencing to detect ct-DNA in patients where we have the genomic profile of the actual tumour for context? \n This was my main research question in Dr. Ryan Morin's lab at SFU, during my undergraduate degree. I wished to detect copy number variants in the tumour genome, and see if we could detect a similar 'scale-up' in the acquisition of reads in these regions from the ct-DNA sequencing. As these things invariably go for a beginner bioinformatician, I instead spent the bulk of my time in the Morin lab learning loads about <a href='http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/22/9/2290.long'>using next generation sequencing data for cancer research</a>, <a href='http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/128/11/1490.long?sso-checked=true'>integrating different NGS data for understanding a cancer</a>, and how to <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28655203/'>write code that doesn't break if I update a single tool</a>. I was also peripherally involved in ongoing work in the lab that <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437943/'>aimed to make genomic analysis accessible to wet-lab folks in bioinformatics.</a>"
