- name: Circulating tumour DNA detection using exome sequencing  
  descr: "Exome sequencing gives us 1% of the total genome. Circulating tumour DNA (ct-DNA) in turn, can comprise <1% of total DNA found in the bloodstream. Can we use exome sequencing to detect ct-DNA in patients where we have the genomic profile of the actual tumour for context? \n This was my main research question in Dr. Ryan Morin's lab at SFU, during my undergraduate degree.
